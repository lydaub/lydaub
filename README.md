## Hi, I’m Lydia Aubourg!
I’m an Information Technology and Informatics student passionate about machine learning, data analytics, and digital communication. I enjoy building projects using Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and scikit-learn to solve real-world problems. I’m always learning new tech and sharing my work to grow and collaborate with the developer community.
