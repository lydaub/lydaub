#### ðŸŽ¯ Featured Project: ML Foundations Final Project 
I built a Logistic Regression model using TF-IDF features to classify book reviews as positive or negative, helping businesses assess customer sentiment for better marketing decisions.

Tools: Python, scikit-learn

Results: Accuracy: 81.25%, Precision: 79.5%, Recall: 83.6%. The results demonstrate that logistic regression with appropriate tuning and text preprocessing can effectively solve this classification problem.
